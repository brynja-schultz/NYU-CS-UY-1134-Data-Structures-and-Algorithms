# Data Structures and Algorithms (Java)

*New York University – Tandon School of Engineering*

## Course Context

This repository contains my programming assignments from **Data Structures and Algorithms (CS-UY 1134)** at NYU, **Spring 2022 semester**.
The course focused on the design, implementation, and analysis of core data structures and algorithms, emphasizing efficiency, scalability, and clean code design.
Assignments applied theoretical concepts to practical programming challenges using Java.

**Tech Stack:** Java · Standard Java Libraries

## How to Run

Compile and run using the Java compiler or your preferred IDE:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

(Some assignments may have differently named main classes.)
